	    <h4 class="left">We chose to link this stanza to this particular scene in the graduate because it allows the reader to see how it creates the atmosphere of a meaningless world. Michelangelo is a renowned renaissance painting whose art is only talked about by the rich and wealthy so these women must be of high class. The idiom coming and going, a general bustle of activity( Wikipedia), suggests that these women are having a gathering in the room. The action of “Coming and going” also seems pointless as the two contradict each other. Together these lines create a sense of both a meaningless world and a lack community. To illuminate the reader of these modernist elements, I linked it to the scene from the graduate where benjamin’s wealthy family friends congratulate him and ask him about his future. This scene demonstrates the lack of community as he hardly knows or trusts any of these family friends. It also shows how the world is meaningless as Ben’s family friends obsessed over his past achievements as a track star and various awards as well a his future. All of this to Benjamin is meaningless.</h4>

  	    <h4 class="left"> Soot is a dirty black powdery substance that is often left over after burning coal. Black soot is often seen on the faces and clothes firemen on trains and coal workers, both of which are seen as low class and less dignified jobs. In this excerpt Elliott uses “let” showing that Prufrock is intentionally humiliating himself by allowing “black soot that falls from the chimney” fall on him. Any sane person wouldn’t think of intentionally humiliating themselves unless they’re a modern hero; in that case anything goes! I linked this to the wedding scene from the graduate where Benjamin crashes Elaine's wedding and runs off with her. In this scene Ben clearly disregards any rules of sense of decency as he bangs violently on the glass and shouts like a maniac. Benjamin clearly thinks that anything goes as crashing a wedding and stealing the bride is not something a sane person would do. This scene exaggerates the modernist theme of the world having no order and highlights this modernist element in our excerpt for readers to see. </h4>

	    <h4 class="left">The first stanza of the poem depicts a run-down city. Elliot describes its streets as half-deserted, the hotels as cheap, and the restaurants like sawdust. In our excerpt of the text, the yellow fog can refer to the heavy pollution from industrialization that haunts this city. This polluted and ruined city would be seen by modernists as a decline in civilization from the lack of individualism. This was made possible through industrialization, where the individual becomes a part of a larger machine (assembly lines). In Simon and Garfunkel’s sound of silence, they mention “the people bowed and prayed. To the neon god they made,” which also illustrates how technology alienates and isolates the individual. I decided to create an image which shows an eye on a phone screen. In the image, the eye is connected to the cell phone wires, meaning we are more connected to electronics than other humans. Lack of community is a prevalent characteristic of modernism that applies to modern technology (which encourages us to spend more time alone).</h4>

	    <h4 class="left">Window-panes are mentioned two times emphasized in our excerpt. Both times the window panes act as a barrier to the yellow fog/smoke as it stops the fog/smoke in its path. This obstruction is show by how the fog/smoke “rubs its back” and “rubs its muzzle” on the window panes. It seems as though the yellow fog/smoke is being trapped by the window panes alluding to the modernist theme of isolation. I chose to create this image of window-panes that look like prison bars. This illuminates the reader by showing how window-panes represent isolation as separates one from the outside world and forces them to be confined in a small space like that of a prison. I used three different window panes and many waves and blurs to show the distortion of reality. This is similar to how Ned from the swimmer slowly sees the truth as he swims across the county. His journey starts off bright and positive but slowly becomes darker harsher until he reaches the end where he sees that he has nothing left. I tried to show that descent with the three different windows finally showing how the window-panes are the prison cell that isolates the world.</h4>

    	    <h4 class="left"> A muzzle is the projecting part of the face, including the nose and mouth. Although many animals have this including dogs and cats, “licked its tongue” and “curled” suggests that this animal is a cat. In this excerpt these qualities are given to the mysterious yellow fog/smoke. Cats are known for being sneaky, acrobatic and agile similar to the movements of the fog/smoke. But the cat being described here is not just any cat, its a stray one. The lines “rubs its muzzle on the window panes” and “rubs its back upon the window panes” suggests that the cat is outside trying to go inside a house, but blocked off by the window panes. I decided to link this with an image of a stray cat I created as it reveals to the reader the modernist theme of isolation. Stray cats are rejected by society as they are seen as dirty and disease ridden. We see a similar battle with society in the modernist text the Swimmer. Ned Merrill was ridiculed, laughed at and had a beer can thrown at him in his journey to swim across the country. With the image of a Stray cat, readers can link this text to other modernist works and see the modernist elements(external battle with formal organizations) hidden within the text.

    	    <h4 class="left"> The “pools that stand in drain” can refer to the water that fills the sewers. This adds to the decrepit atmosphere of the described city. In modernist literature, water can also represents the subconscious mind. The sewage water could mean that the subconscious is clouded or muddied. Similarly, in The Swimmer, as Neddy Merrill swims through the different pools, they get darker and murkier. The dirty water can represent a variety of modernist characteristics including isolation and a meaningless world. For this connection, I wrote a haiku. The first line portrays the relation between water and the subconscious. The second line shows that even if you’re thinking straight, the subconscious can be murky nonetheless. Finally, the third line represents the subconscious clearing up. In the second haiku, I stayed with the theme of the subconscious. The first two lines describe someone who is struggling internally. While in the last line, the same person suddenly finds a silver lining representing quick changes of the subconscious (just as the fog wanders through the city). Though traditionally, these poems generally portray seasons, I decided to take a more contemporary approach while maintaining the structure of an ancient haiku.</h4>

This relates to Fog, a poem by Carl Sandburg, which also compares fog to a cat. In the second stanza of Fog, the “cat” watches over the city before moving on. Similarly in our stanza, the cat moves throughout the city before it “Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.” Alternatively, another definition for terrace is “A row of houses built in one block in a uniform style” (Oxford Dictionaries). In this case, a terrace can represent a uniform society that a modern hero might struggle externally against.</h4>

This sudden leap from the yellow fog (pollution), could represent a heavy push in the manufacturing of arms/military goods. This connects to The Graduate and how Benjamin Braddock’s normal life before graduation becomes a world without order; he has an affair, finds love, and elopes with a married women. The picture that I chose is a propaganda poster from World War 1 which pressures women into working manufacturing jobs. In these war times, many people were subjected to the government's authority through conscription and other policies.

I linked this to an image of a person falling in deep water. Water represents the realm of dreams, imagination and feelings that lie below the surface and is often used in modernist pieces like the Graduate and the Swimmer to represent the subconscious. In the Graduate, for example, we see Ben enter his subconscious when he goes diving in his pool. Right after this scene Ben has an affair with Mrs. Robinson showing that his subconscious mind is beginning to take over. From this link readers can see the subtext of the subconscious in this text and can expect a possible twist as the character’s subconscious begins to take over.</h4>
